# Image encryption & decryption
This is a Python-based project, provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt image files using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. It offers a simple command-line interface for users to perform encryption and decryption operations on image files securely.
## Features:
- AES Encryption: Encrypt image files with a strong 128-bit AES encryption algorithm.
- AES Decryption: Decrypt encrypted image files using the corresponding decryption key.
- CBC Mode: Utilizes the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode for enhanced security.
- Padding: Automatically applies padding to the image data before encryption and removes it after decryption.
## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install the required libraries 
- Run the script by executing python image_encrypt_decrypt.py.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt image files.
